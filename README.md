July 28th, 2025

* Fixy things
  * Further amendment to abilities operating from the intent; properly includes static abilities (was missing)
  * Added missing TOC links and reorganized the hierarchy of sections within game mechanics
  * Added Load as a gamer term. Split "Negated" from Negate as a game term; they are now listed as separate terms in the Glossary
  * Added section on simultaneous selection rules
* Will start to reorganize rules such that each entry, if it is not a general description within a section, will be itemized under subchapter headings to give better indexing of rules. E.g., A chapter flow should read starting with a broad description (if applicable), followed by General Rules, and then subsequent specific subchapters delineating specific areas of those rules. This reformatting will be trialed and prone to feedback. The first section to undergo this change is General Rulesm, which has also received reorganization and clarification changes in each section
* Consolidated Durability, Life, Power, and Speed under [Stats](general-rules/general-rules-parts-of-a-card/parts-of-a-card-stats.md) section
* Revamped [Object and Targeting](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-objects-and-targeting.md) section
* Other various changes (have fun)
* Integrated with [GitHub](https://github.com/weebsoftheshore/gitbook-rules) via GitSync. Now any changes will be reflected on GitHub, along with diffs of the changes. This patch will troubleshoot this feature



July 18th, 2025

* Rulebook update in anticipation of DTR:
  * Aethercharge/Aetherwing is described under functional subtypes
    * Aetherwings are loaded with Aethercharge cards in the same way Guns are loaded with Bullets or Bows are loaded with Arrows. Aethercharge cards are Spells with power stats that allow the player to load them into an Aetherwing as they resolve
    * [Aethercalling](glossary/keywords-and-abilities.md#aethercalling) Added to keywords
  * [Cardistry](glossary/game-terms.md#label-keywords) added as a label keyword
  * Section on special continuous effects added, which includes [time distortion](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-types-of-effects/types-of-effects-continuous-effects/special-continuous-effects.md)
  * [Ephemerate](glossary/keywords-and-abilities.md#ephemerate) and [On Charge](glossary/keywords-and-abilities.md#on-charge-n) added to keywords
    * [Ephemeral](glossary/game-terms.md#ephemeral) added as a property
  * [Exalted element](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-special-elements.md#exalted) added
  * [Servile Possessions](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-mastery.md) mastery added
* Amended conditions for attacker roles in combat. Previously, the attacker's role ended simultaneously with the loss of all defending units. The attacker role will be preserved until the end of combat, and its attack target can be redirected or reselected from a legal/null target/no target to a valid target
* [Amended rules for ability activations from the intent](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-abilities/). Cards in the intent can activate abilities as if they were objects, with the exception of costs such as resting and sacrificing (since you can't rest or sacrifice an intent, you can only do these actions with objects)
* Additional rule for Command attack cards added regarding the intent
* Various fixes
  * Added missing keywords



June 25th, 2025

* No functional changes.

* Revised section on card/ability resolutions with "default choice" on optional resolving modes added



March 14th, 2025

March 5th, 2025

* Added comprehensive [typing list ](glossary/type-list.md)in the Glossary.
* Added keywords and counters new to HVN: Siegeable, Kindle, as keywords and Wither as a new functional counter.
  * Siegeable has required that some sections of the rulebook including On Hit, On Kill, Dies/Destroy, Cleave, and other combat-based rules to be modified to be inclusive of domains as attackable objects while not being considered units.
* Added section on [double-faced cards](general-rules/general-rules-card-characteristics/double-faced-cards.md) and the player action transform.

* Slightly expanded public vs private information concerning previously-public or previously-private information and play permissions.
* Clarified damage events from the perspective of damage sources.
* Clarified Opportunity context in the Materialize phase
* Updated typing and characteristics of triggers to inherit those of their sources. This is important for Strategem triggers vs Spellshroud and other similar cases. The definition of Spellshroud has been updated accordingly.
* Updated Format Conventions regarding draft to match the TRG (and fixed a minor duplicated numbered list bug)
* Cleaned up the section regarding the intent, now should read as intended.
* Fixed bug in logic regarding leveling/playing champion requirements (now explicitly have to satisfy legal conditions).
* Expanded "discrete events" regarding drawing cards to other similar classes of deck interaction, e.g. banishing, putting into graveyard, etc.

\
\
February 7th, 2025

* Slightly modified rules regarding steps for play methods. There is now a second mode selection step during reserve cost payment in the case of payment method either modifying or adding additional modes or selections. This is essentially a "hotfix" for Imbue.



February 3rd, 2025

* Expanded section for resolving [dependencies](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-types-of-effects/types-of-effects-continuous-effects/#dependencies).



December 4th, 2024

* Added clause to Preserve mechanic: You can return a Preserved card if you are given an option or opportunity to materialize, regardless if you have something to materialize (e.g. your material deck only consists of Preserved cards or a non-regalia card is underneath Quicksilver Grail. You would not have to reveal the card that was underneath Grail except for during the end of game procedures.
* Added clause regarding multiple retaliating units and order of damage assignment. Additional rule set regarding a "killing blow" rule where only the unit inflicting lethal damage will trigger its On Kill ability. Subsequent units after the "lethal" unit can still trigger On Hit abilities if the damage dealt is in excess.

  * Clarification on default opportunity after activations and materializations.

August 22nd, 2024

* Cleaned up [Special Game Actions](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-miscellaneous-topics/special-game-actions-and-turn-based-actions.md) section (Drawing cards removed, rules text of cards excludes special game actions. This is mostly out of consideration for the Eternal Magistrate interaction on turn 1 for Spirit champions.)
* Modified [negation](glossary/game-terms.md#negate) rules (negating will send things to the graveyard by default, but if the resolution of a negated card were to change the zone it would be placed in, negating will send it to the same place it would have gone upon resolution)
* Cleaned up section on [Searching and Finding](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-miscellaneous-topics/searching-and-finding.md) with respect to failure to find among public cards
* Reconciled language on Enlighten counters across various sections on the rulebook
* Fixed [On Hit ](glossary/keywords-and-abilities.md#on-hit)being unclear with regards to combat damage sources (applies to retaliation as well)

* (Re)Added hindered
* Brew rules are now more explicit

July 1st, 2024

* Reworked section on Properties and States to be more explicit/straightforward
* Added note on copying object activations
* Fixed card types only specifying activation at slow speed (playing at slow speed is default)
* [Vigor](glossary/keywords-and-abilities.md#vigor) is now a triggered ability instead of being part of the turn-based actions during End Step procedures, in line with the intended triggered effect of Agility. This also means that Vigor is no longer redundant. [End Phase](game-mechanics/game-mechanics-turn-order/turn-order-end-phase.md) steps have been adjusted accordingly
