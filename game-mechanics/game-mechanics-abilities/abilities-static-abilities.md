# Abilities - Static Abilities

#### General Rules:

1. Static abilities do not use the Effects Stack and instead are always passively and persistently enabled, affecting the game state continuously.&#x20;
2. An ability is static if it does not have a point at which it ends or would be specified to end.
3. Static abilities generally create [continuous effects](../game-mechanics-types-of-effects/types-of-effects-continuous-effects/).
4. Cost-modifying static abilities will not change the cost of the card as printed in any zone; they will only modify the payment for that cost.

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g., a card with a reserve cost of 7 and Efficiency with the champion’s level equal to 3 will require that the player pay 4 reserve for activating the card, however, if a card were to negate the activation of cards with reserve cost of 6 or higher, the card would still be negated.
