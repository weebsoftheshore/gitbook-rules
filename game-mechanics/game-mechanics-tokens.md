# Game Mechanics - Tokens

#### General Rules:

1. Token is an object classification. Unlike cards, which are represented by a physical Grand Archive card, a token is an object that is created by effects with defined characteristics (such as name, element, cost, power, life, etc.) but is not represented by a physical card.
   1. A token can be represented on the field physically in any manner, as long as this representation is clear to both players. E.g., coins and dice are commonly used to denote tokens in play.
   2. A token may be represented by an officially printed Grand Archive card, which lists Token on the typeline.&#x20;
      1. Token is not a card supertype (since tokens are not treated as cards).&#x20;
   3. Tokens serve as representative proxies of objects instanced in the game.
2. A token is physically represented on the field, usually by a tangible object as a game piece.
3. Tokens can't exist in the Graveyard, Banishment, Main Deck, Material Deck, Hand, Memory, Intent, etc; A token ceases to exist if it (or rather, the object it represents) is moved to any zone other than the field.
4. Copies of objects are tokens; copies created on the Effects Stack or Intent are not tokens.
5. Control of a token uses the same rules as when an object enters the field; ownership defaults to the controller of the effect that created the token.
