# Game Mechanics - Mastery

Masteries are special non-object player functions and are typically granted by various effects. Players can only have one mastery at a time.



#### General Rules:

1. If you get another mastery, it replaces your current mastery.
2. Cards interacting with certain masteries may have symbols and icons related to that mastery on the card.
3. Cards that track and represent masteries cannot be placed or used in any decks (Main, Material, Sideboard) and only serve to visually reflect the active Mastery.





#### Masteries:



#### Fractured Memories

&#x20;                                            ![](https://api.gatcg.com/cards/images/fractured-memories-rec-brv.jpg)

1. Fractured memories is an Assassin Skill mastery with two static abilities:
   1. The first ability is a "Merlin Bonus" restriction static ability that says, "Your champion has 'On Ally Kill: Put X sheen counters onto your Fractured Memories, where X is the amount of sheen counters that were on the killed ally.'"
   2. The second ability is a "Merlin Bonus" restriction static ability that says, "Your champion has "On Champion Hit: You may move all sheen counters from the hit champion onto your Fractured Memories. When three or more counters are moved this way, deal 3 damage to that champion.'"
2. Certain cards and abilities may have a "Sheen X+" restriction. This restriction ability statically checks the number of sheen counters present on the Fractured Memories mastery. If a sufficient number of sheen counters is present, the restricted ability becomes unlocked.
   1. On Enter abilities with a "Sheen" restriction can't trigger unless the requisite number of sheen counters are present when the On Enter ability would trigger.

#### Phantasmagoria

&#x20;                                            ![](https://api.gatcg.com/cards/images/phantasmagoria-ptm.jpg)               &#x20;

1. Phantasmagoria is a Cleric Spell mastery that has three different abilities:
   1. The first ability is a static ability that says, "Non-Specter cards in your graveyard lose all abilities."
   2. The second ability is an "Alice Bonus" restriction static ability that says, "Whenever a Specter ally you control dies, put a haunt counter on Phantasmagoria."
      1. Haunt counters have no intrinsic abilities and do not confer any abilities themselves.
   3. The third ability is an "Alice Bonus" restriction triggered ability which says "At the beginning of your end phase, you may put all cards from your graveyard on the bottom of your deck in any order. If you do, put the top X cards from your deck into your graveyard, where X is the amount of haunt counters on Phantasmagoria."
      1. If you opt to move cards from the graveyard, moving zero cards is valid to trigger the second part of the ability, which generates a reflexive trigger that is then put on the stack.

#### Servile Possessions

&#x20;                                             ![](https://api.gatcg.com/cards/images/servile-possessions-dtrsd.jpg)

1. Servile Possessions is a Guardian Skill mastery has a modal triggered ability behind the "Ciel Bonus" restriction ability that says, "Whenever your champion attacks, depending on the number of Omens you have" has different resulting effects:

* 1 or 2 Omens — That attack gets +1 power.
* 3 or 4 Omens — That attack gets +2 power.
* 5 or more Omens — That attack gets +3 power. Draw a card into your memory.

2. The modes for Servile Possessions are mutually exclusive and not additive.
3. The resolving trigger creates a continuous effect that statically applies the attack power bonus.
4. "Omens" refers to any cards in the controlling player's banishment with omen counters on them. Cards will remain omens even if Servile Possessions is lost.





#### Shifting Currents

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/shifting-currents-ambsd.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/bagua-of-cardinal-fate-amb.jpg)

1. Shifting currents is a triggered ability that says, "At the beginning of your end phase, you may change the direction of your Shifting Currents to a different direction of your choice." This ability is behind a restriction ability of "Kongming Bonus."
2. Shifting Currents has four modes that may be chosen. Each mode is represented as a "direction" of either North, South, East, or West. Shifting Currents can only be set to one mode at a time, and changing the mode will overwrite the previous mode.
   1. The starting mode is always "North."
   2. Only one mode can be chosen at a time.
   3. If a card's rules text references any of Shifting Currents' modes, it will be reflected as direction icons on the bottom left of the card.
   4. An adjacent direction for shifting currents is defined as the following: North and South are each adjacent to both West and East; West and East are each adjacent to both North and South.
