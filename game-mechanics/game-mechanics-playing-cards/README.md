# Game Mechanics - Playing Cards

Activating or materializing a card counts as playing that card.

Only a cardâ€™s owner can play that card.

If an attempted play is illegal, that play is canceled and the game state will revert to the point before the play was initiated.

All cards in the Effects Stack are controlled by the player who played them.
