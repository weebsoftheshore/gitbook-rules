# Special Continuous Effects

This section covers special continuous effects that modify game rules to significant degrees.

#### Time Is Distorted

1. When time is distorted, players skip their regular Materialize phase. Instead, they gain an additional materialize phase after their Main phase, before the End phase.
   1. The added Materialize phase follows the same turn-based action orders and any gaining of opportunity within the phase as with the default Materialize phase. However, this phase will not transition to another Recollection phase (and subsequent Draw and Main phase). After all players have passed on Opportunity successfully (if any Opportunity was given as a result of a materialization), the game will proceed to the End Phase.
   2. All players must pass Opportunity, and the Effects Stack must be empty in order to proceed from the Main phase to the Materialize phase, as players normally would when transitioning from the Main phase to the End phase.
2. Time can't be distorted again; any subsequent effects that distort time will do nothing. No additional material phase will be generated.
