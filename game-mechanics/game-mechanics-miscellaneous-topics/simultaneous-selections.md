# Simultaneous Selections

Whenever players are instructed to make a choice regarding choosing or selecting a card, sometimes the players must make a choice at the same time. While this is possible when cards are face down, selection for public cards must follow a specific order.&#x20;

General Rules:

1. For selections and choices made simultaneously in public zones or concerning public cards (i.e., they are face-up, or at least have a publicly defined characteristic while face-down), the turn-player must make their selection first. Each other player in the game will make their respective choice in turn order.
2. For selections regarding face-down or private cards, players will set aside cards from the hidden set until all players have made their choices. Following this, the private selections are revealed at the same time.
