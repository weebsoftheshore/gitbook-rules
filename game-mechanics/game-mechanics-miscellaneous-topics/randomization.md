# Randomization

Randomization in this game is used to determine outcomes of random events and the random ordering of decks after shuffling.

#### General Rules

1. For a method to determine outcomes to be random, an object used to generate a random result must be fair.&#x20;
   1. Objects considered fair for use in randomization include dice with two or more sides in which each side has an equal chance of resulting after tossing that object.
      1. A fair coin is acceptable as a two-sided die for this purpose.
2. When selecting random events, a die with more sides than results needed to be determined can be used if it is easily scalable or if there is a fair method agreed upon among players to determine results.&#x20;

E.g., if a player must banish a card among five from memory, a D20 (20-sided die) may be used where values 1-4 are assigned to the card in the 1st position, 5-8 are assigned to the card in the 2nd position, 9-12 for the 3rd position, 13-16 for the 4th position, and 17-20 for the 5th position.
{% endhint %}

3. Sufficient shuffling and randomization of cards that are not uniquely identifiable, and having an opponent choose from among those cards, is considered a fair selection method.
4. For shuffling a deck, only methods that generate a sufficiently random state may be used.
   1. The deck shuffled must be in plain view of your opponent and/or event judge.
   2. After a player shuffles a deck, they present their deck to an opponent to cut or further shuffle the deck.
