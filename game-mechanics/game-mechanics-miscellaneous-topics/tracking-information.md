# Tracking Information

Trackable information includes marked champion damage and the various counters that can be placed on objects.

Players may track temporary marked damage on allies using similar methods, however, players must clear this tracked damage at the end of each turn to properly represent the game state.

Multiple objects may be used to keep track of any counters on an object, such as dice, coins, or other countable markers or symbols.
