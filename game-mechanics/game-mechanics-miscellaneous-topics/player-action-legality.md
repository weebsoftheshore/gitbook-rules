# Player Action Legality

#### General Rules:

1. A player action is considered illegal if it directly contradicts any of the above rules of the game and results in a game state that can't be resolved.
2. If a card’s rules text contradicts the rules of the game, the card’s rules take precedence. In all cases, “can’t” overrules “can” if there are conflicting effects of the same kind.
3. A player action is not illegal if it is simply unclear and the case should be brought to an event judge or game authority.
4. A situation is unclear if both players in a game reach different conclusions regarding the outcome of an event or process within the game.
5. If necessary, the ruling goes through an official process via a rules committee for amendment of the game rules.
