# Concession

At any point in the game, a player may choose to concede the game.

1. In a two-player game, the opponent of the player immediately wins the game.
2. In a multiplayer game, the game will continue considering that the player to have lost until there is a winner of the game.

Conceding is not bound by any timing restrictions and may be done at any point in the game.

Conceding supersedes any effects that specify that the conceding player cannot lose the game.

After a game result is obtained through a concession, any subsequent games will follow as normal, following format conventions and match structures.
