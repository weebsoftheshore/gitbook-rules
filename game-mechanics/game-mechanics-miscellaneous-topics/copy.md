# Copy

Some cards or abilities can become a copy of a card, object, or ability, or may generate an object that is a copy of a card, object, or ability. Copying can refer to the effect of copying an object or card activation. A copy can refer to the copied card, object, or ability. A copied card, object, or ability, is still considered an activation/materialization and can be targeted as such.

#### Copying Objects

1. When an object is copied, the new copy has all characteristics of the base printing of the current face of that card without any modifiers such as counters, rested/awake statuses, or other continuous one-shot effects applied to the card.
   1. Some properties that affect the card (as opposed to just the object the card has become) can be copied, such as: Imbued.
2. Any choices or modes made while the original was on the field do not count as copiable information or characteristics for the new object. If any abilities ask that a player choose an effect, this choice is not impacted by nor will it impact the original object’s choice.

E.g., If a copy was made of Nia, Mistveiled Scout, the copy’s controller may choose a different card name from what was named by the original Nia while the new object’s On Enter ability is resolving. The new Nia will not “remember” which card was chosen by the original.
{% endhint %}

1. Any subsequent changes to the original copy will not cause any changes in characteristics to any of the copies of the original.
2. When an object is copied, the copied object is solely used to reference characteristics, regardless of whether or not the copied object is itself a copy.
3. Copying a transformable card will cause the copy to have only the characteristics of the face-up side. This copy will not be able to transform unless it has a valid corresponding side.

#### Static Copying

1. Some objects may enter the field as a copy of another object. If it does, the generated object will act as if it enters as the original card with any On Enter abilities being placed onto the Effects Stack, if able. Otherwise, it will copy all other characteristics as point 1 made above.
2. Entering as a copy is not a triggered ability like On Enter.

#### Copying Abilities or Copying Card Activations

1. Copying an ability or card activation will cause another instance of that ability or card to be placed onto the Effects Stack with any chosen modes, alternative costs, values of X, or other choices made during activation to be identical to the new copy.
2. Any choices made during resolution are separate from those made during activation and may be different.
3. If there is any property or characteristic of cards or objects associated with the activation, that information is also copied.&#x20;

E.g. an Imbued action activation that is copied will produce an Imbued copy.

4. A copied activation of a card with an object type (such as Ally or Item) will cause the copied activation to enter as a token copy of that object with any characteristics matching those of the printed values.

Copied card activations and copied objects are under the control of the player who generated the copy.

A copied ability has the same source as the original ability activation and references by name will refer to the source of the original ability.

Copy effects that state a player may choose new targets or modes for the copied ability or card activation allows the player to choose new targets or modes. This will not allow the player to modify any choices made in activating the original copy.
