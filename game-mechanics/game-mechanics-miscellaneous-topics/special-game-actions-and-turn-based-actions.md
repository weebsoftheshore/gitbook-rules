# Special Game Actions and Turn-based Actions

Special and turn-based game actions are events that either a player takes or which the game will perform that cannot be responded to by any players in any circumstances.

No players are considered the source for turn-based actions.

Opportunity is never given nor are players able to obtain Opportunity during special and turn-based actions being completed.

Special game actions are excluded from modifications to game rules by rules text of cards and effects.

E.g., Eternal Magistrate can't prevent Lv 0 Spirit champions from being placed onto the field during a player's first turn as this is a special game action.

Special game actions:

* Putting into play a Level 0 champion at the start of the game. This also does not count as a materialization.
* Player concession
* During the end phase:
  * Removal of temporary marked damage
  * Ending end-of-turn effects ("until end of turn, this turn, as your turn ends," etc.)
  * Discarding down to imposed hand size limits.
* Loading cards using the Aethercalling ability.
* Pre-game actions



Turn-based actions:

* Waking up objects as part of the Wake Up phase
* Players returning cards from their memory to their hands as part of recollection
* Players drawing a card as they enter the draw phase.
* Damage being dealt simultaneously during the damage step of the combat phase.
* Putting charge counters on cards with On Charge abilities during recollection.
