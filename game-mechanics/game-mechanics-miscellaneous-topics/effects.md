# Effects

Effects are considered to be all of the rules text of an ability that impacts that game.

Some effects may state that a player “may” (do something) as it is resolving. The effect is in this case is optional and the player or players only must decide whether they opt for the effect as the ability is being resolved.

Some effects will use the word “unless.” These effects will generally check for a specified condition and will change their behaviors based on whether or not that condition is satisfied or absent. These abilities may also use the words “If not” to represent an alternative effect.
