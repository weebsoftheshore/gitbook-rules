# Effects

#### General Rules:

1. Effects are considered to be all of the rules text of an ability that impacts the game.
2. Some effects may state that a player "_may"_ perform an action as instructed by the rules text as it is resolving. Opting to perform the action and enact the corresponding effect is optional.
   1. The player(s) only must decide whether they opt for the effect as the ability is being resolved.
3. Some effects will use the word “unless.” Rules text using "unless" generally check for a specified condition and will change the resolved effect(s) depending on whether the condition is satisfied.
   1. These abilities may also use the words “if not” or similarly qualifying syntax to represent a default/alternate case.
