# Properties and States

Properties are characteristics of a card or object relating to its individual information or certain mutable or temporary characteristics. Some cards or effects may reference or depend upon these properties. A state is a mode of a property or a way in which that property can be set.

If a state of a property were to try to be set to the state it already is in, the state will not change.

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g. If an object or card were in the "rested" state, resting that card or object will not cause that card to "become rested" â€” it will simply be rested and the game will not observe a change in the card's state.
{% endhint %}

General Card Properties

1. Facing: The facing of a card is a property with states of being either face-up or face-down. This property is used to determine whether its information is considered public or private.
   1. Face-down cards in all zones except for the field have no properties except for being a card with set properties or characteristics defined by effects.
   2. If a private card is set face down in a specific zone after having been selected for certain characteristics or properties, that card must be revealed at the end of the game.
2. Orientation: The orientation of a card is a property with states of being either Awake or Rested. This property is typically used to determine whether an object can be rested to pay for costs, attack, or retaliate.
