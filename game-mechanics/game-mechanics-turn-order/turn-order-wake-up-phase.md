# Turn Order - Wake Up Phase

1. During this phase, the game simultaneously wakes up each rested object on the field controlled by the turn player. This is a turn-based action and cannot be responded to. Units that are awake will not be considered to have woken. If an ability would put one or more triggered abilities onto the Effects Stack, the turn player gains Opportunity after each ability pending resolution is placed onto the Effects Stack. The phase will continue to the next step after the Effects Stack is empty.
2. After each object that needed to be woken up is awake, the game will attempt to move to the Materialize phase.
