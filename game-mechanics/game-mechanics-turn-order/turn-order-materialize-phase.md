# Turn Order - Materialize Phase

1. The materialize phase is skipped on each playerâ€™s first turn during a game.
2. If an ability would put one or more triggered abilities onto the Effects Stack at the beginning of this phase, the turn player gains [Opportunity](../game-mechanics-timing-and-permissions.md#opportunity) after each ability pending resolution is placed onto the Effects Stack. The phase will continue to the materialization step (3) of this phase after the Effects Stack is empty.
3. In this phase, the turn player may choose to materialize a card from their material deck as a turn-based action. Players may only materialize a regalia or champion card from their material deck during this phase. If a player opts to materialize in this way, it counts as a materialization where Opportunity is generated, and players may respond to the materialization. After this round of Opportunity has passed, no additional window to take actions will be generated apart from those from abilities pending resolution.
4. After the Effects Stack is empty and all players have passed Opportunity in succession, the game will move to the Recollection phase.
   1. If the turn player did not materialize a card, no Opportunity will be given and the game will immediately move to the Recollection phase.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Players are not naturally given Opportunity at the beginning of the Materialize Phase. Opportunity will only arise if the turn player opted to materialize a card or if there were any triggers placed on the effects stack during Step 2. If neither of these events happens, no Opportunity is generated, and the game will proceed to the Recollection phase.
