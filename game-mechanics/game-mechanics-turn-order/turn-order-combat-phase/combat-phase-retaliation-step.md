# Combat Phase - Retaliation Step

1. First, if any abilities or effects were placed onto the Effects Stack during or after attack declarations, players will receive Opportunity in turn order to respond to these effects. After the Effects Stack is empty, the game will proceed to step 2.&#x20;
2. Second, turn player receives opportunity. This point at which players are granted Opportunity during this phase is considered “before retaliation” and is the only time players may act before the game progresses until the damage step is entered.
3. Third, if there are any awake defending units, for each of those units, its controlling player may choose to rest that unit to retaliate against the attacking unit.
   1. If they do so, the unit being retaliated becomes the target of retaliation of the retaliating unit and the retaliating unit will deal damage according to its power stat to its retaliation target during the Damage Step.
   2. Units without a power stat or with a power stat of 0 or less cannot retaliate. Weapons can’t be used to retaliate or during retaliation.
4. Then, after the Effects Stack is empty, and each player has passed on Opportunity in succession, the game immediately proceeds to the Damage Step of combat.
