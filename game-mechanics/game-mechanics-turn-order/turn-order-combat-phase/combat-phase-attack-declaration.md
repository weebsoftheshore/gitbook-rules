# Combat Phase - Attack Declaration

1. First, a player declares an attack. After an attack declaration, the turn immediately enters the combat phase.
2. Attack declarations cannot be responded to and no player receives Opportunity as a result of an attack declaration.
3. Attack cards must first resolve and enter a championâ€™s intent before attack declarations can be made and combat can begin.
4. After an attack is declared, any On Attack triggers are placed onto the Effects Stack and players will be able to respond at the beginning of the Retaliation Step of combat.
5. Combat will not end as a result of either all defending or all attacking units leaving the field during combat; the combat phase will still proceed through all combat steps and sub-phases.
