# Turn Order - Ending Phases

If an effect or condition ends a phase of the game, all effects in the Effects Stack will not resolve and all cards in the Effects Stack will be banished.

1. If there are any sub-phases or steps associated with the phase other than the ending of a phase, those will be skipped and the game will immediately proceed to the end of the phase.
2. If the combat phase is ended, the game will proceed to the end of the combat step and then immediately proceed to the main phase.

If an effect or condition ends the turn, all effects in the Effects Stack will not resolve and all cards in the Effects Stack will be banished. The game will immediately proceed to End Phase Step 4, the final part of the End Phase, complete any associated game actions, and then directly proceed to the following turn.

3. The card or ability that ended the phase will not be banished itself; it will (by default) go to the graveyard as it resolves before the phase is ended.&#x20;
