# Turn Order - End Phase

The end phase begins after the turn player chooses to end their main phase and proceed to the end phase.

1. First, any effects that specify the “beginning of the end phase” are placed into the Effects Stack.
2. Second, the turn player receives Opportunity. This point at which players are granted Opportunity during this part of the phase is considered “before end of turn” and is the only time players may act before this phase and turn progress to their conclusion.
3. Third, after all effects are resolved and all players have passed on Opportunity in succession, the game immediately proceeds through a series of the following special game actions.

Temporary damage marked on allies is removed.

Any “until the end of the turn,” “this turn” or other (similar effects (EOT)/one-shot effects) end, and any effects that happen “as turns end” or “as your turn ends” (or other variations) occur.

If any hand-size or memory-size limits are imposed, the turn player must discard cards from either of the zones until the limit is not exceeded.

State-based actions are checked.
