# Turn Order - Main Phase

1. First, the turn player receives Opportunity.
2. During this phase, the turn player may perform any slow or fast player actions while they have Opportunity and the Effects Stack is empty or they may proceed to the end phase.
3. Attacking is considered to be a slow player action and will immediately put the game through the [combat phase](turn-order-combat-phase/). The game will return to the main phase after the end of combat.
4. If any player actions were taken during the passing of Opportunity or any effects, activations, or materializations entered the Effects Stack, the turn player receives Opportunity after the Effects Stack becomes empty and the player can again perform slow or fast player actions.
5. Non-turn players may only activate cards or take player actions at fast speed during this phase when they have Opportunity.
6. If the Effects Stack is empty and no other player actions have been taken while Opportunity was being passed, the main phase ends and the game immediately proceeds to the end phase.
