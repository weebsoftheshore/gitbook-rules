# Turn Order - Skipping Phases

If an effect or condition would skip a phase in the game, that phase does not happen. No turn-based actions or effects would take place that are tied to that phase and a player would never receive Opportunity to take player actions during that phase if they would be granted Opportunity during that phase.

Phases can be skipped multiple times. If this occurs, those phases will be individually skipped, even across multiple turns, if necessary.

The skipped phase will not proceed through any end-of-phase effects or turn-based actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g. If a player’s End Phase were skipped, nothing that would take place during the End Phase (such as end of turn effects) would take place. If a pending trigger specified “the next end phase,” it would happen during the next player’s End Phase. If a pending trigger instead said “your next end phase,” it would happen during your next turn’s end phase.
