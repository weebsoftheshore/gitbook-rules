# Turn Order - Recollection Phase

1. At the beginning of the recollection phase, any “beginning of recollection” abilities will enter the Effects Stack.
2. After the Effects Stack is empty, the turn player will immediately gain Opportunity. This is the last time players may act before the recollection of cards in the memory zone will take place as a turn-based action.
3. Then, after the Effects Stack is empty and all players have passed Opportunity in succession, the turn player returns all cards in their memory zone to their hand as a turn-based game action that can’t be responded to. This is called recollection.
4. After the turn player finishes recollection, the game will move to the Draw phase.
