# Game Mechanics - Turn Order

Turn order follows Wake Up, Materialize, Recollection, Draw, Main, and End phases.

1. In a two-player game, the first turn player skips their first wake up, materialization, recollection, and draw phases, and instead puts a Level 0 champion into the field from their material deck and proceeds to their main phase. The second player skips their first wake up, materialization, and recollection phases, and instead puts a Level 0 champion into the field from their material deck before proceeding to their draw phase and then to their main phase.
2. In a multiplayer game, the first turn player will follow the sequence of events as denoted for the second player in the above point, i.e. they will not skip their first draw phase. Each other player will also follow the same sequence of events for each of their first turns.

The turn player receives Opportunity at the beginning of the Recollection phase, the Main phase, and the beginning of the End phase. These are the only non-combat phases in which the turn player will be given Opportunity naturally.

A phase where players are given or gain Opportunity can end if and only if the Effects Stack is empty, all players have passed Opportunity in succession, and all events or actions associated with that phase are completed.

If no players are given Opportunity in a phase, that phase instead ends after all phase actions are completed and the Effects Stack is empty.

Any effects that last “until end of \[phase]” end as that phase ends before the next phase begins.

Any effects that trigger “at the beginning of \[phase]” are triggered and placed onto the Effects Stack and the turn player gains Opportunity when that phase begins.

Game events can’t happen between phases and steps; events will always happen in one of the discrete phases or steps within a phase.
