# Game Zones - Graveyard

The Graveyard zone is a public zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Graveyard zone.&#x20;

The Graveyard zone is referred to by the term “graveyard.”
{% endhint %}

Any card that would be sent to the graveyard is put into its owner’s graveyard.

Cards in the graveyard must be kept in a single, uniform pile.

Any card that is [negated](../../glossary/game-terms.md#negate), [destroyed](../../glossary/game-terms.md#destruction), [discarded](../../glossary/game-terms.md#discard), or [sacrificed](../../glossary/game-terms.md#sacrifice) is put into its owner’s graveyard. Action cards are placed into their owner’s graveyard after they resolve. Attack cards are placed into the graveyard from the intent during the End of Combat step.
