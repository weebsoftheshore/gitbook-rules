# Game Zones - Main Deck

The Main Deck is a private zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Main Deck.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Main Deck zone can be referred to by the terms “deck” or “main deck.”
{% endhint %}

Cards in each player’s Main Deck will start in their respective Main Deck zones.

The deck must be maintained in a single, uniform pile.

Players can’t look at or change the order of cards in their deck.

Each deck must start the game in a randomized state.

A player may only shuffle their deck when instructed to do so by an effect or in-between games to randomize the deck.

A player may not look through any decks while in the game and may only look through their deck in between games.

Players can only draw cards from the deck.

If an effect instructs a player to play with the top card of the deck revealed, the top card must always be revealed. If a player is drawing multiple cards within one action sequence, each card drawn from the deck must be revealed.
