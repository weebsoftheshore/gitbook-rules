# Game Zones - Effects Stack

The Effects Stack zone is a public zone shared by all players and has no owner.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The Effects Stack zone is referred to by the term “effects stack.”
{% endhint %}

The Effects Stack contains an ordered collection of stacked card activations, materializations, and abilities pending resolution which uses a stacking structure. Each discrete item in this zone has its own layer and each layer will resolve on its own. The topmost layer is the first card to resolve any time an item in the effects stack were to resolve whereas the bottom layer corresponds to the item that would resolve last. In essence, this zone uses a first-in-last-out (FILO) system.

Once a card or ability resolves from the Effects Stack, each of its effects will fully resolve as it is removed from the Effects Stack.

E.g. Glacial Guidance will still grant an enlighten counter as it is ending the combat phase.\

Players can’t change the order of cards in the effects stack.
