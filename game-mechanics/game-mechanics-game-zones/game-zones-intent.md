# Game Zones - Intent

#### General Rules:

1. The Intent zone is a public zone, and each champion has an Intent zone owned by the champion’s controlling player that exists during the Combat Phase.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Intent Zone and all cards within that zone are referred to by the term “Intent.”
{% endhint %}

2. All cards in the Intent are intents. Any card can, in theory, be sent to and exist in the intent.
   1. Copies made of Intents are still Intents. However, they are not cards and will cease to exist when they are removed from the Intent.
3. Cards in the intent are considered the source for any triggered or activated abilities from within the intent.
