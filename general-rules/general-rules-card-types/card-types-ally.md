# Card Types - Ally

Ally objects are ally units, are attackable, and can be the target or choice for effects.&#x20;

Ally cards can only be played at slow speed.&#x20;

Ally objects enter the field awake.

Ally objects may attack while awake.

Ally objects may retaliate when attacked, if they are awake.

An ally card goes to its ownerâ€™s graveyard when the ally object is destroyed. Allies with 0 life or less, or an amount of damage marked equal to or greater than their life stats will automatically be destroyed as a result of state-based effects before any player can take any player actions.
