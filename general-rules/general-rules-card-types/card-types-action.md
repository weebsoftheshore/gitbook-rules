# Card Types - Action

An action card can be activated at the speed specified on the card.&#x20;

Targets of an action card must be specified when the card is activated.

Action cards and their effects are invalidated if all necessary targets specified by the action card are invalid or illegal for targeting. This is also known as "[fizzling](../../glossary/game-terms.md#fizzle)." Optional targets (such as “up to \<number>”) do not count towards fulfilling necessary or required targeting conditions.

When activated, action cards are placed on the Effects Stack before resolving.

After the action card resolves or fizzles, it will go to the graveyard.
