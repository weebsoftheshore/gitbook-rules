# Card Types - Action

General Rules:

1. An action card can be activated according to the speed stat specified on the card.&#x20;
2. Targets of an action card must be specified when the card is activated.
3. Action cards and their effects are invalidated if all necessary targets specified by the action card are invalid or illegal for targeting. This is also known as "[fizzling](../../glossary/game-terms.md#fizzle)." Optional targets (such as “up to \<number>”) do not count towards fulfilling necessary or required targeting conditions.
4. When activated, action cards are placed on the Effects Stack before resolving.
5. After the action card resolves or fizzles, it will go to the graveyard.
   1. If any part of its effect specifies that it would go elsewhere, it will go to the specified zone, even if it fizzles. The same applies to any external [continuous effects](../../game-mechanics/game-mechanics-types-of-effects/types-of-effects-continuous-effects/) that may modify where it would go.
