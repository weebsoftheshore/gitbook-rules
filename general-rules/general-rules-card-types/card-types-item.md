# Card Types - Item

Item is also an object type.

Items have reserve costs in the main deck. If they are in the material deck, item cards have the regalia supertype and will have memory costs instead of reserve costs.

Items may only be played at slow speed.

Items go to their owner's graveyard when they are destroyed.
