# Card Types - Attack

General Rules:

1. Attack is also an intent type and may be targeted while in the Intent as a "target intent."
2. Attack cards can only be played at slow speed and rest the champion as an additional playing cost.
3. Attack cards become declared attacks as they enter the intent.&#x20;
4. Attacks (as an intent) may be used together with a weapon.&#x20;
5. Once an attack card is activated, it is placed onto the Effects Stack where it can then resolve.
   1. If the attack card is negated or fizzles, the attack card goes to the graveyard and does not enter the Intent. No attack will be declared, and the champion remains rested.
6. Once an attack card resolves, it is placed from the Effects Stack into a championâ€™s Intent zone and is then referred to as the attack until the Combat Phase that was started ends. The player that activated it must declare an attack on a legal attack target, if possible, and a combat phase immediately begins. If no such target exists, the attack will fizzle, and no attack declaration will be made (see 5.a.).
7. Damage from the attack card is dealt simultaneously with all other contributors to combat damage during the Damage Step. No player receives Opportunity, and no actions may be taken nor any events may occur during the time this process is completed.
8. Attack cards will go to the graveyard from the intent during the End of Combat step of the [Combat Phase](../../game-mechanics/game-mechanics-turn-order/turn-order-combat-phase/).
