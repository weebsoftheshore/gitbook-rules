# Card Types - Attack

Attack is also an intent type.

Attack cards can only be played at slow speed and rests the champion as an additional playing cost.

Attack cards become declared attacks after they enter the intent.&#x20;

Attacks (as an intent) may be used together with a weapon.&#x20;

Once an attack card is activated, it is placed onto the Effects Stack where it can then resolve.

1. If the attack card is negated, the attack card goes to the graveyard, no damage is dealt, and the champion remains rested.
2. Once an attack card resolves, it is placed from the Effects Stack into a championâ€™s intent zone and is then referred to as the attack until the Combat Phase that was started ends. After an attack card resolves, the player that activated it must declare an attack to a legal attack target, if possible, and a combat phase immediately begins. If no such target exists, the attack will fizzle and no attack declaration will be made.
3. Damage from the attack card is dealt simultaneously with all other combat damage during the Damage Step. No player receives Opportunity and no actions may be taken nor any events may occur during the time this process is completed.

Attack cards will go to the graveyard during the End of Combat step of the [Combat Phase](../../game-mechanics/game-mechanics-turn-order/turn-order-combat-phase/).
