# Card Types - Supertypes

General Rules:

1. Cards have a supertype that may sometimes be listed that modifies rules for the card.
2. Supertypes are dependent on the card type; if the card type is changed, the supertype will also be changed, either to the default of having no supertype or to whatever it is being set to.

#### Unique

1. Unique is a supertype that specifies that a player may only control 1 unique object on the field with that name at any time. If a player controls 2 or more unique objects with the same name, that player is forced to sacrifice any of those objects until they only control 1. This will be done when the game attempts to move to the next game state before any effects are resolved, Opportunity is passed, or the game returns to a player’s main phase. I.e., the game will only progress after the rule for unique objects is satisfied.
2. If two objects on the field share the same name, but only one is unique, the game will not require the player to sacrifice one of those objects.

#### Regalia

1. Regalia is a supertype for cards that specifies that the card must start in the material deck.
2. Deckbuilding restrictions for cards in the material deck apply to regalia as well; a player may only have up to one copy of a specific regalia in their material deck at the start of a game.
3. All regalia have a memory cost.
4. If a regalia card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, it is instead banished.
5. If an effect specifies that a regalia would be sent to the hand, main deck, or memory, it returns to its owner’s material deck when it leaves the field instead.
