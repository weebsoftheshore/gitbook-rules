# Card Types - Weapon

General Rules:

1. Weapon is also an object type; After a weapon resolves, it will enter the field as a weapon object.
2. Weapons have reserve costs in the main deck. If they are in the material deck, weapon cards have the regalia supertype and will have memory costs instead of reserve costs.
3. Weapons may only be played at slow speed.
4. Weapon cards have a power and durability stat.
   1. A weapon enters the field an object with [durability counters](../../glossary/game-terms.md#durability-counters) equal to its printed durability stat.
   2. The durability of a weapon is the number of durability counters it currently has.
   3. When a weapon is used in an attack, a durability counter is removed in the damage step of the combat phase. Durability is still removed if the damage dealt is 0. Durability will not be lost if the damage step of combat is skipped.
5. A weapon object is destroyed as a state-based action if the durability of that weapon reaches 0.
   1. Damage being prevented during the damage step by any effect does not prevent the weapon from losing durability.
6. Weapons go to their ownerâ€™s graveyard when they are destroyed.
7. Weapon objects can allow a champion to attack.
   1. Allies can't use weapons.
