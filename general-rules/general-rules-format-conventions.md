# General Rules - Format Conventions

Each standard constructed game of Grand Archive is played between two players, each with their own main deck and material decks.

1. Main decks can have a minimum of 60 cards and a maximum of four copies of a card with the same name.
2. Material decks can have a maximum of 12 cards and a maximum of one copy of a card with the same name.
3. Material decks must contain a Level 0 champion at minimum.
4. Sideboards contain a maximum of 15 cards. Sideboards use a 15 point system where cards in the [Main Deck](../game-mechanics/game-mechanics-game-zones/game-zones-main-deck.md) are worth 1 point and [Regalia](general-rules-card-types/card-types-supertypes.md)/[Champion](general-rules-card-types/card-types-champion.md) cards are worth 3 points. Sideboards can consist of any combination of Main Deck cards and Regalia/Champion cards that does not exceed 15 points or 15 cards for the Sideboard.

Each standard draft game of Grand Archive is played between two players, each with their own main deck and material decks.

5. Main decks can have a minimum 30-count main deck. Maxmimum limits on copies of cards are draft format-specific.
6. Material decks are limited to a deck size of 10 and must contain at least one Level 0 champion.
7. Your sideboard consists of all cards in your pool.

Card names, costs, and their elements must exactly match a corresponding card in the Grand Archive Index to be considered legal for deck building.

8. In non-sanctioned matches, a card whose information (such as name, cost, element, etc.) is modified to that of another card may be treated as if it is the card the modified card would represent (if such a card exists within the Index).
9. The effects of a given card will behave based on the listed rules and effects of the corresponding card in the Index, regardless of the text box of the card or any modifications therein.

Tournament structures including match structures, sideboarding rules, round time limits, etc. are not covered in the GA comprehensive rules and are discussed in a separate document.
