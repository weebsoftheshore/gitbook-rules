# General Rules - Players

During a turn in a game of Grand Archive, players are designated as the turn player and non-turn players.

General Rules:

1. The turn player is the player controlling the turn, the passage of phases during the turn, and the events that take place during the main phases within the turn.
2. The turn player may perform slow player actions at any time during their main phase while the Effects Stack is empty.

Players may activate abilities or play cards at fast speed when they have Opportunity.

3. Non-turn players can't perform Slow Player Actions at any time.
4. When the turn ends, the turn player ceases to be the turn player, and the next player in the turn order immediately becomes the turn player.
5. A multiplayer game is considered any game that includes 3 or more players.
