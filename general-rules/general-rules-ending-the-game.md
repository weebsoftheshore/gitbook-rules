# General Rules - Ending the Game

General Rules:

1. A game of Grand Archive ends when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.



2. A player wins the game if any of the following become true:

* All opponents’ champions die
* All opponents do not control a champion when a player receives Opportunity and those players previously controlled a champion
* All of the player’s opponents have lost the game
* An effect states that the player has won the game.



3. A player loses the game if any of the following become true:

* Their champions die
* The player does not control a champion when a player receives Opportunity and previously controlled a champion
* That player attempts to draw a card from an empty deck
* An effect states that the player has lost the game
* They concede
* They would win and lose simultaneously.



4. A game ends in a draw if either of the following is true:

* An effect states the game is a draw
* All remaining players lose or win the game simultaneously



5. When a player loses a game, all cards and objects owned by that player are removed from the game and returned to that player. All face-down cards with specified properties or characteristics (i.e., those beyond simply being a card) are revealed; those cards are turned face-up and shown to all players before that player may add those cards to their original decks for shuffling. (See [here](../game-mechanics/game-mechanics-properties-and-states.md) for information on properties)
   1. In a multiplayer game, if that player controlled another player’s object(s) and that object(s) did not have a previous controller, that object will immediately cease to exist in the current match. Otherwise, the object will return under the control of its previous controller.
   2. An object ceasing to exist as a result of a player losing the game will not be considered to have died, be destroyed, be banished, or have any other change of game state applied to it other than the object having left the field of play.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g. If that object has an “On Leave” ability or would trigger an ability of another object observing that object to leave play, only those abilities will trigger.
{% endhint %}



After a game, all cards and objects owned are then returned to their respective owners.&#x20;

If playing a game within a match structure, main deck and material deck cards are reshuffled in their respective decks, and tokens are set aside.
