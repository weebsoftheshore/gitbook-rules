# Parts of a Card - Element

All cards have an element denoted in the top right of the card.&#x20;

The element specified on the card must be enabled for a player for that player to play that card.

The norm element is unlocked innately for all players.

Non-norm elements are unlocked innately depending on the elements of champion cards within the lineage (see [Lineage](../../glossary/game-terms.md#lineage-term)); non-champion cards do not unlock elements.

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g. A player has a lineage containing a Spirit of Water, norm champions, and an arcane champion, that player may play or activate norm, water, and arcane cards.
{% endhint %}

Champion cards are not bound by element restrictions when materializing.

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g. a player may materialize a Level 3 champion with the crux element type without previously having the crux element enabled as long as the other rules for leveling up that champion are followed.
{% endhint %}

Basic elements are Fire, Water, and Wind elements; Advanced elements are any elements that are not Fire, Water, Wind, or Norm.
