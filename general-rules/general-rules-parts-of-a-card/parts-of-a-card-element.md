# Parts of a Card - Element

General Rules:

1. All cards have an element denoted in the top right of the card.
   1. If a card or object is not specified to have an element, it is Norm by default.
2. The element specified on the card must be enabled for a player for that player to play that card.
   1. The norm element is unlocked innately for all players.
   2. Champion cards are not bound by element restrictions when materializing.
3. Non-norm elements are unlocked innately depending on the elements of champion cards within the lineage (see [Lineage](../../glossary/game-terms.md#lineage-term)); non-champion cards do not unlock elements.

{% hint style="success" %}
E.g., A player has a lineage containing a Spirit of Water, norm champions, and an arcane champion; that player may play or activate norm, water, and arcane cards.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
E.g. a player may materialize a Level 3 champion with the crux element type without previously having the crux element enabled as long as the other rules for leveling up that champion are followed.
{% endhint %}

4. Basic elements are Fire, Water, and Wind elements; Advanced elements are any elements that are not Fire, Water, Wind, or Norm. Exalted is a [special advanced element](../../game-mechanics/game-mechanics-special-elements.md) that is unlocked by default as long as you have a champion that enables another advanced element.
