# Parts of a Card - Text Box

The text box of each card is reserved for rules text as well as flavor text. Rules text is written in non-italicized font and any reminder texts or flavor texts are written in an italicized font.

1. All non-italicized text constitutes card abilities and/or effects.
2. Line breaks for effects and abilities separate independent abilities. Triggered abilities separated by line breaks are treated as separate triggers; a triggered ability without line breaks is considered a single ability.
3. The only text used for consideration of effects and gameplay is non-italicized.
   1. Reminder text functions to remind players of keyword definitions or intention for effect resolution.
   2. Italicized text apart from label keywords has no impact on gameplay.
4. Yellow bubbles with numerals can be used to represent reserve costs, either as costs for abilities or as costs as part of an effect.

Names of some cards may be shortened within its rules text. Instances of a shortened name in this fashion are treated as if it were the full name of the card.
