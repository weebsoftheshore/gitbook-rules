# Parts of a Card - Text Box

General Rules:&#x20;

1. The text box of each card is reserved for rules text as well as flavor text. Rules text is written in a non-italicized font, and any reminder texts or flavor texts are written in an italicized font.
2. The only text used for consideration of effects and gameplay is non-italicized.
   1. Reminder text functions to remind players of keyword definitions or intention for effect resolution.
   2. Italicized text apart from label keywords has no impact on gameplay.
3. Line breaks for effects and abilities separate independent abilities. Triggered abilities separated by line breaks are treated as separate triggers; a triggered ability without line breaks is considered a single ability.
4. Yellow bubbles with numerals within the rules text can be used to represent reserve costs, either as costs for abilities or as costs as part of an effect.
5. Names of some cards may be shortened within their rules text. Instances of a shortened name in this fashion are treated as if they were the full name of the card.
