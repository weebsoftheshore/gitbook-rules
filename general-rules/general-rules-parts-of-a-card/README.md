# General Rules - Parts of a Card

General Rules:

1. Cards consist of components of Name, Cost, Type, Class, Element, Speed, Power, Life, Durability, and Rules Text which all define a cardâ€™s characteristics. All cards have a Name, Cost, Type, Class, and Element.
2. Cards with a Class Bonus ability have watermark icons that correspond to the classes of the card and for which champion classes that Class Bonus is unlocked. These icons do not affect gameplay.
