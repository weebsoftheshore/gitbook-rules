# Parts of a Card - Durability

Some cards have a durability stat noted on the bottom right side of the card designated with a shield icon. The durability of an object refers to the number of durability counters it currently has.

1. The durability stat correlates to how many uses that card has or how many attacks a weapon may be used in. Attacking removes a durability counter as combat ends&#x20;
2. An object enters the field with durability counters equal to its durability stat.
3. More durability counters may be placed on an object than the durability stat.
