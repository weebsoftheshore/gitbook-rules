# Parts of a Card - Typeline

Cards have a card type listed on the left side of the middle segment of the card in the typeline.

The types are [Champion](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-champion.md), [Ally](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-ally.md), [Action](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-action.md), [Attack](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-attack.md), [Weapon](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-weapon.md), [Domain](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-domain.md), [Item](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-item.md), and [Phantasia](../general-rules-card-types/card-types-phantasia.md).

* Champion cards have a life stat.
* Ally cards have both a power and a life stat.
* Action cards have a speed stat.
* Weapon cards have a power and a durability stat.
* Attack cards have a power stat.

Ally, Action, Weapon, and Attack cards generally have class subtyping.

1. A class subtype will be the first subtype listed on the typeline.
2. Cards can have multiple subtypes with multiple class subtypes divided by a “/” on the card.
3. Cards can be activated regardless of class typing.

Cards sometimes have characteristic subtyping such as “Reaction,” “Skill,” “Harmony,” or “Melody.” These characteristics may be referenced by abilities as conditions for certain effects.
