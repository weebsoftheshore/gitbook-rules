# Parts of a Card - Name

The name of the card will be found in the middle section of the top bar between the card cost and the card element.

Card names are unique.

1. Named lineages are specified to determine a type of champion card. For example, all forms of Rai champion cards are part of the Rai lineage.
2. If a card must be named or a card of a chosen name is specified for an effect, the full name of the card must be specified.
   1. Shortcutting the name of the card can be achieved if the intended card to be named can be sufficiently described such that each player in the game understands the card intending to be named without ambiguity. If shortcutting is not possible due to a lack of mutual understanding, the player naming a card will provide the full name of the intended card. (Players can use the Index for assistance at any time.)
   2. The corresponding card may be indicated or represented in the Index.
