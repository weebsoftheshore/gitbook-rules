# Parts of a Card - Speed

Cards (typically actions) have a written speed stat denoted as either [Fast](../../glossary/game-terms.md#fast) or [Slow](../../glossary/game-terms.md#slow) on the bottom right of the card.

The speed stat of a card determines the timing rules and restrictions that activating that card must follow.
